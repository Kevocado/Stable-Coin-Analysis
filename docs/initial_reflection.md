# Initial Reflection: Emerging Markets Analyst
**Project:** Stablecoin Remittance Analysis
**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Date:** November 2025

## 1. Chosen Persona
* **Role:** Emerging Markets Analyst
* **Organization:** International Development Organization (e.g., World Bank) or Fintech (e.g., Wise).
* **Mission:** Investigate if stablecoins are a viable alternative to traditional remittance rails (Western Union/MoneyGram/Remitly).

## 2. Refined Business Questions
* **The Volume:** What portion of network activity looks like "remittance" behavior (small transfers <$1,000) vs. institutional trading?
* **The Cost:** Can Ethereum Mainnet beat the 'Digital-Only' benchmark of 3.55% ($7.10), or is it only competitive against the expensive 'Global Average' of 6.49% ($12.98)?
* **The Usage:** Is USDT actually being used for frequent, small transfers, or is it mostly sitting in large idle wallets?
* **The Entities (New):** Who are the major actors? Can we identify flows to regional exchanges (e.g., LatAm vs. Asia) or is it dominated by global whales?
* **The Divide:** Does the data show a clear split between "Global North" speculation (high value) and "Global South" utility (low value, high frequency)?

## 3. Key Metrics
* **Digital Benchmark ($):** A static line at $7.10 (The price to beat).
* **True Crypto Cost ($):** Gas Fee + $1.50 (Off-ramp estimate).
* **Geographic Proxy:** Transaction counts bucketed by UTC Hour (Asia vs. Americas working hours).
* **Entity Type:** % of Volume flowing to CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) vs. DeFi vs. Unlabeled.
* **Regional Divergence:** Avg Transaction Size in "Africa Window" vs. "Asia Window".
