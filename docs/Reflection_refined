# Initial_Reflection.md

## Team & Persona
- **Team Name**: Group 15
- **Persona**: Emerging Markets Analyst
- **Organization**: International Development Organization (or remittance company like Wise)
- **Stablecoin Choice**: USDC or USDT? (Focus on ONE)
- **Time Window**: Last 6 months (or last 90 days if data is dense)

## Primary Business Questions (Pick 2–3)
1. What % of transactions are <$1,000 (remittance-sized)?
2. How do on-chain fees (gas + off-ramp) compare to $7.10 benchmark?
3. Are there time-of-day patterns suggesting retail usage (e.g., weekday mornings)?
4. Where do transfers concentrate: exchanges (cashing out) vs. DeFi (trading) vs. P2P?

## Key Metrics We'll Need
- Daily/weekly transaction volume (count AND USD value)
- Transaction size distribution (percentiles: p10, p25, median, p75, p90)
- Average gas cost per transaction (in USD, including off-ramp estimate)
- Hourly activity patterns (UTC hour) to proxy geographic usage
- Top 20 wallet types (CEX, DeFi protocol, labeled retail, unknown)
- Volume flowing to regional exchanges (if labelable)

## Initial Hypotheses (Will Test)
- [ ] Most volume is large transfers (>$10k) → institutional
- [ ] Gas costs alone exceed $7.10 on Ethereum Mainnet
- [ ] Peak activity aligns with "Global North" trading hours, not "Global South" remittance hours
- [ ] Top 20 addresses hold >80% of daily volume → not useful for retail
