 Team & Persona
- Team Name: Group 15
- Persona: Emerging Markets Analyst
- Organization: International Development Organization (or remittance company like Wise)
- Stablecoin Choice: USDC or USDT (Focus on ONE for deep analysis)
- Time Window: Last 6 months (or last 90 days if dataset is very large)

Primary Business Questions (Pick 2–3)
1. What percentage of stablecoin transactions are small transfers (<$1,000)—do they resemble remittance behavior, or are they mostly large/institutional trades?
2. How do on-chain fees (gas + off-ramp cost) compare to the digital remittance benchmark of $7.10 per transfer?
3. Do we see usage patterns (e.g., time of day, weekly cycles) that align with retail users, or are peak periods dominated by speculative trading?
4. Where do transfers concentrate: exchanges (cashing out), DeFi protocols (trading), or P2P addresses?

Key Metrics We’ll Need
- Daily/weekly transaction volume (count and USD value)
- Transaction size distribution (percentiles: p10, p25, median, p75, p90)
- Average gas cost per transfer (in USD, including $1.50 off-ramp estimate)
- Time-of-day activity (UTC hour) to infer geographic usage
- Top 20 wallet types (centralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, identified retail, and unknowns)
- Volume flowing to regional exchanges or wallets (if identifiable)

Initial Hypotheses
- Most stablecoin volume consists of large-value institutional transfers, not retail-sized remittances
- Ethereum Mainnet transaction fees often exceed the $7.10 benchmark
- Peak activity is seen during US/EU trading hours ("Global North"), rather than "Global South" retail remittance periods
- The largest 20 wallets account for most transaction volume, indicating concentration among whales rather than widespread retail utility
