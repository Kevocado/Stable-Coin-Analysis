# Research Notes & Benchmarks

## 1. The Benchmark (Traditional Finance)
* **Global Average Cost:** ~6.49% to send $200 (World Bank Q4 2024).
* **Digital-Only Benchmark:** ~3.55% (e.g., Wise/Remitly).
* **Target:** Our solution must be consistently cheaper than $7.10 (3.55% of $200) to be viable.

## 2. The Stablecoin Choice (USDT)
* **Asset:** Tether (USDT).
* **Rationale:** Highest liquidity in emerging markets (Asia, LatAm, Africa) compared to USDC, which is more US-institutional.

## 3. The "Apples-to-Apples" Cost Formula
We cannot just compare Gas vs. Western Union. We must use:
> Total Crypto Cost = Gas Fee (Sender) + Exchange Fee (0.1%) + Off-Ramp Fee (~$1-$3)
