# Refined Business Question: Global North vs. Global South Flows

## The Core Question
**"Can we quantify the net capital flow from 'Global North' domiciled exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Kraken) to 'Global South' domiciled exchanges (e.g., Binance LatAm, Bitso) using on-chain stablecoin transfer data as a proxy for cross-border remittance?"**

## Why this refinement?
1.  **Specific & Measurable:** It moves away from vague "visualizing the divide" to a concrete measurement of **net capital flow** between specific entities.
2.  **Technically Feasible:** It acknowledges the pseudonymity constraint by explicitly using **Exchanges (CEXs)** as the geographic proxy, rather than impossible-to-know wallet locations.
3.  **Hypothesis-Driven:** It directly tests the hypothesis that stablecoins are moving *from* wealthy nations *to* emerging markets, which aligns with the "Remittance" narrative.

## Methodology
*   **Assets:** USDC, USDT, DAI (The dominant stablecoins).
*   **Geographic Proxy:**
    *   **Global North:** Coinbase, Kraken, Circle (Issuer), Uniswap (DeFi proxy often associated with sophisticated/western capital).
    *   **Global South:** Bitso (LatAm), Binance (Global/Emerging Markets), Yellow Card (Africa), Tron-heavy wallets (often associated with emerging market USDT usage).
*   **Metric:** Monthly Volume (USD) sent from [North Group] -> [South Group].
